About PySDL2
============

PySDL2 is a wrapper around the SDL2 library and as such similar to the
discontinued PySDL project. In contrast to PySDL, it has no licensing
restrictions, nor does it rely on C code, but uses ctypes instead.

Installation
============

PySDL2 is easy to install and integrate within your own projects. Just
follow Python's standard procedure of installing packages or look for a
prebuilt package for your operating system or distribution.

Documentation
=============

If you just started with SDL and PySDL2, it is strongly recommended
that you read through the tutorial of the documentation to learn the 
basics. You can find the documentation at *doc/html* or online at
https://lukems.github.io/py-sdl2.

License
=======

This library is given to the public domain. There are no licensing
restrictions. Please see *doc/copying.rst* for further details.
